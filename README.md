## 🧠 Key Learnings & Technical Concepts

### 1. Data Fetching & API Integration

- **What I did:** Fetched pizza menu and order data from APIs.
- **Skills gained:** Using async/await, handling loading and error states, integrating with real or mock APIs.

### 2. State Management with Redux Toolkit

- **What I did:** Managed global state for cart, user, and orders using Redux Toolkit slices and selectors.
- **Skills gained:** Creating slices, reducers, actions, selectors, and using Redux DevTools for debugging.

### 3. Advanced Async Logic with RTK Thunks

- **What I did:** Used `createAsyncThunk` for async actions like fetching addresses and submitting orders.
- **Skills gained:** Handling async flows, managing pending/fulfilled/rejected states, and updating UI accordingly.

### 4. Form Handling & Validation

- **What I did:** Built complex forms for order placement, including validation and error feedback.
- **Skills gained:** Controlled components, form validation, error handling, and UX best practices.

### 5. React Router Fetcher & fetcher.Form

- **What I did:** Leveraged React Router's `fetcher` and `fetcher.Form` for decoupled data mutations and form submissions.
- **Skills gained:** Understanding of advanced routing patterns, non-navigational data mutations, and improved user experience.

### 6. Geolocation & Address Auto-Fill

- **What I did:** Integrated browser geolocation API and reverse geocoding to auto-fill user addresses.
- **Skills gained:** Working with browser APIs, handling permissions, and chaining async operations.

### 7. Responsive & Modern UI with Tailwind CSS

- **What I did:** Designed a responsive, mobile-friendly UI using Tailwind CSS utility classes.
- **Skills gained:** Responsive layouts, utility-first CSS, and accessibility improvements.

### 8. Order Tracking & Status Updates

- **What I did:** Implemented real-time order status tracking and delivery time estimation.
- **Skills gained:** Using timers, conditional rendering, and dynamic UI updates.
